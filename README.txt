My blog is created using Bootstrap


 https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

Use the above link for the Bootstrap docs, I've included their navbar, buttons, and colors.

Currently the blog lacks additional pages, I'd highly recommend rebuilding the blog using Next.js for their superior and fast page routers.
React.js is also built into Next.js, React.js will allow for a more dynamic blog that immediately and without refreshing, update the blog with new comments/posts. This would be possible using many of the React.js hooks that come pre-built and ready for use.

Overall a good start for a blog, but will require implementation of the more modern functions and syntax associated with them.
